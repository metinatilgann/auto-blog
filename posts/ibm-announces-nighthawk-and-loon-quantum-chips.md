IBM announces Nighthawk and Loon quantum chips. IBM has introduced two different quantum chips that it believes could help demonstrate "quantum advantage," or the ability for a quantum computer to solve a problem faster than a classical computer, by the end of 2026. The new chips, Nighthawk and Loon, should help do that by taking different approaches to connecting qubits in a quantum computer, producing fewer errors and supporting more complex computations...
